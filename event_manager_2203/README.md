 * installing a gem
 * using `IRB` (or `pry`)

## Learning Goals
After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

 * manipulate [file](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/File) input and output
 * read content from a [CSV](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/csv/file/README.rdoc) (Comma Separated Value) file
 * transform it into a standardized format
 * manipulate [strings](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String)

For this project, two data files have been saved to the `data` directory:

 * `event_attendees.csv`: small sample data file (~20 lines)

 * Accessing Columns by their Names
 * Displaying the Zip Codes of All Attendees

## Iteration 2: Cleaning up our Zip Codes
 * Pseudocode for Cleaning Zip Codes
 * Handling Bad and Good Zip Codes
