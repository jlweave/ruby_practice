## Learning Goals

* Understand the common roles of a team in a professional setting
* Discuss possible arrangements for working in groups at Turing
* __Understand the importance of taking a front to back approach to projects__ (Why not start by creating all of your migrations up front?)

## Warmup (5 minutes)

* What has made your previous teams successful? What has made them difficult?
* When working together for the first time, what can you do/have you done to make sure your team is productive?

## Tuckman's Group Lifecycle

### Stages of the Group Lifecycle( ~5 min )

* [Watch this quick video as a class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhSI6oBQmQA&list=PLbu6naAjG_K93h0wjyn1b1EHQl1Q2pH_y)
* [Put this pdf up to reference during discussion](http://salvos.org.au/scribe/sites/2020/files/Resources/Transitions/HANDOUT_-_Tuckmans_Team_Development_Model.pdf)

### Discussion( ~20 min )

Think of those successful teams from your warmup questions. What did you do to get you through the early stages to become successful?

Share - be sure to highlight:

* Honesty
* Treating team members as more than just the work they do
* Goal Setting
* Accountability
* Retrospective and review

## Tools and Workflow (30 min)

### Waterfall vs Agile

[Use this picture to drive discussion](http://www.agilenutshell.com/assets/how-is-agile-different/continuous-activities.png)

* Discuss differences between these approaches.
* How would this apply to a project you've completed here at Turing?
* How might this apply to a Sinatra project?

### Waffle

* Show how to convert the requirements of the project to stories/issues on Waffle (e.g. Average GPA - average_gpa returns the average GPA for all students)
* Let the stories drive development, even copy and paste the story into the tests
* Use waffle to track tasks to be completed
* Use waffle to keep you focused (i.e. avoid rabbit holes)

### Git Workflow

Discuss Casey's [Git Workflow for Teams](https://gist.github.com/case-eee/22906249d7a2acead8a897813b7a9675)
