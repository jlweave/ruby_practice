# Basic Introduction to Developer Tools

All major web browsers have implemented a version of Developer Tools. For this lesson, we'll focus on Chrome's Developer Tools.

### Navigating Dev Tools
* Open Dev Tools
  * On a mac use: `Cmd` + `Opt` + `I`
	* OR right click on the mouse anywhere in the browser and select Inspect
	* OR select `View` in the navbar, open `Developer` and select `Developer Tools`

* You can also pin the tools to top or right
* ... and break them out into their own window
