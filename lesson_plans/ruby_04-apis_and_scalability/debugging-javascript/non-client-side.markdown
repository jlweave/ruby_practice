# Debugging Non Client-side Code

`debugger` won't always work for you when you leave the client-side JS world.

Why not?

Think about what happened when we typed `console.log` into the browser's dev tools and got `[native code]`.

## Some Resources

When you get to Node, check out the [Node debugger](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html).

You can also look at [pry.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pryjs)

And finally, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is Regis approved. It's another IDE, but does have some intense functionality. 

And you can check out an [atom package](https://github.com/kiddkai/atom-node-debugger) that's supposed to do something similar.

[Node Inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector) is also a good resource, courtesy of 1511.
