# Student Suggestions/Notes

## How Can We Get Mentors More Involved?

- Give them earlier notice of the projects being done and people's interests
- More accessible info about how to reach out to them
- Make info about students' projects easily accessible

## What Should We Change Next Module?

- Explain options earlier so we can think/plan what we want to do
- Tailor lessons based on what groups or individual people are doing
- Assign team leads to group projects

### Future Work for LookingFor

* Heat map of jobs location
* Graphs & charts of trends - data visualization
* Search by company
* More testing of the React app
* 2 people on ElasticSearch - better search in general
* Being able to search by location and company (seperately)
* Accounts - so users can save their searches or favorites
  * Lia and past students could also tag where they've worked or interviewed so that current job-searchers can use that information to see where they might know someone or get info on the interview process
* Expand where jobs are pulled from - it is currently limited
  * GitHub
  * Craigslist?
  * Others that people could look into?

### Ideas for Balancing Job Hunt and ScaleUp

* May have been harder for those in group projects - make sure expectations are set at the beginning about what will be completed, what priorities are - people in groups felt pressure to complete certain features and less time than those working individual
* Is there competition? Do people feel like they can't have jobs with each other?
* Can we talk more broadly in standups? Meeka talked about everything she did, we only talked specifically about our project work. But if we talked about job stuff in standup too?
* Weekend before ScaleUp - set expectation around doing something job related during that time, specifically defined by staff
* People are in really different spots in their job hunt - make sure everyone has their resume completed during intermission week before starting the module, etc.
* Can we talk about cover letters at some point? These are taking people a really long time and is harder than it seems like it should be

## Next Time a Requirement that you *must* work on an existing project. Discuss?

It helps to give direction to what you're doing when the functionality already exists and you're trying to add on to it.

Having an existing codebase more closely resembles the job field.

What constitutes green vs. brown field? Is what Boxtrot-Prime did this time a green field project? They basically gutted the whole front end, and deployed an independent project that is only connected to the back end through AJAX calls. On top of that, the back end wrote new endpoints. It's basically all green.

Where do you learn more? You can't get very far in a greenfield project in two weeks, especially when you're learning a new language/technology. Brownfield education sort of depends on the app. In looking-for there wasn't much new information to learn from. It was more repetition, and refactoring to cement existing knowledge. Unless the brownfield app is in a totally new language/framework. Then it's got the same sort of upsides/downsides as the greenfield


## How can we speedup the start of the project?

Launch on Friday? Give a better idea of what research is needed. Start writing issues and acceptance steps. Get project pulled down and deployed locally. "Losing" a day for the holiday was hard. Maybe issues could still be written collaboratively on Thursday or Friday before.

Also, some extra heads up on the project would be nice. Knowing that doing another personal project was an option would have been good to know in advance, or coming up with ideas for issues and features on the projects.

Pairing on pre-work?

Accountability in the pre-work ( to make sure everyone is actually ready on Monday )

## What Should We Keep Next Module?

##### Chelsea: Likes the way the module has gone but would like a class on web sockets.

##### Nick: Would like to keep the scale up project as is, it was a really great experience working on a team with an existing codebase. It was hard to follow along with class written in ES6 when I was primarily using ES5.

##### David: David is at odds with himself because he likes more pressure. He would like more pressure. So the independent study wasn't enough pressure for him. More accountabliity for Tangie Whisko. One class on webpack VS express - a class on how to set up your own starter kit.

##### Adam: Adam echos David's sentiments for the Tiskey Whango project. More accountability. Some of the lessons we received during the scale up project could have been relevant earlier in the program. They were good but could have been useful earlier. A web responsive CSS class in mod 2 would have been FANtastic.

### Ideas for more defined team leadership

##### Nick: There should be a vote at the beginning of the project and select team leaders for back end and front end teams. Who is authorized to merge PR's?

##### Chelsea: Plus 1 for team leaders on LookingFor project.

##### David: Possibly Whangey Tisko pairs that could code review each other's PRs.

##### Adam: Team Leadership should just be more defined goals for Tisko Whangey. The loosey gooseyness of the project was nice but it was a way different experience than the boxtrot peoplez.
