- Is requestAnimationFrame like Document.ready()
- Why, in requestanimationFrame do we do recursion, as opposed to a general loop? How/why do we avoid timeouts or slowing down?
- Why are you able to do:
```
  var s = "string";
  String.prototype.x = 50;
  s.x // returns 50
```
If strings are not objects?
