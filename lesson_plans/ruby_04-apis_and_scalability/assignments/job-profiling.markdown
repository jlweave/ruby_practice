## Job Profiling Assignment

There's an old saying - every company in tech is either hiring or in danger of going belly up.

There's another old saying - literally every tech company wants a senior developer with 5 years of experience in a framework that's 1 year old.

Do _not_ wait to pursue a company just because you haven't seen them post a 'Looking for a Junior Developer' ad. You'll be waiting a long time.

Instead - complete this assignment.

## Deliverable

  - [Respond to this Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/YzZ1sFPJSfbjVtRR2)
    - Addendum: If you have already signed on for a job, only profile that company.
