## The Concept of Require - Research

When you start working with WebPack for GameTime, you'll notice that you can't just define a variable in one file and find it in another as easily as you can in Rails.

## Deliverable

  - Read [Node.js, Require and Exports][rblog] and [Organize Your Code with RequireJS][rblog2]
  - Fork This Gist
  - Respond in your forked gist with answers to the following questions
    - In the context of Node, what is a `module`?
    - The code examples from the second blog post look very different from the first. Why?
