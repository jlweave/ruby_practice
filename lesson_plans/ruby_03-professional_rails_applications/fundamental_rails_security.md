## Setup Prior to Class

* Set up [OregonSale](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/store_engine) prior to class. There won't be time for us to set up during class. Look at the `README` for details.
* Download the [Postman App](https://www.getpostman.com/)

`$ git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/store_engine.git fundamental_security`

## Procedure

1. Mass Assignment
