# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
* this is one of the easier conditionals as it was also taught to us with math when we were younger.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
* This is also another conditional that as long as you remember && is and , where || is or it is easy enough to complete.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
* This one was the hardest of the three because of the elsif. It just takes a little more brain power than the other ones.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
* I believe that I spent about an hour on this lesson which is what I was thinking it would be. A lot of this was gone over in Trycoding so it wasn't completely new information, but it was great to go back over it again.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
* I think that I will still run through a few more examples of if statements to make sure that I am solid on them. I don't think that I need to do anything to my calendar to incorperate this.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
No question still remain, I got all of the issues figured out while working through this project.
