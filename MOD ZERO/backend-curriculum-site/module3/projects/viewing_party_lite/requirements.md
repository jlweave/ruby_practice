## Viewing Party Requirements

**OPTIONAL**

### Requirements
Project specification requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/viewing_party_lite/projects/1)

You will need to create your own project board on your repository. Feel free to copy the cards we have on the above linked board to add to your own project board. 

Wireframes found [here](./wireframes) can be used as an additional reference


### Exploration Topic Ideas

- Additional API consumption
- Add functionality such that a user must accept an invite to a movie party
- Implement basic authentication for a user 
    * require a password field to user registration, and create log in and loggin out functionality 
    * utilize sessions/cookies to remember a logged in user
- Implement low level, server side caching for API calls
