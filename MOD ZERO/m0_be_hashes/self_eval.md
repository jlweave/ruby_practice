# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I don't think I struggled with this section.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I am still working on what to be putting in my notes. There is so much information that it is hard to not write out everything/

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I normally go to google if after a while I can not figure out why my code is not working.
