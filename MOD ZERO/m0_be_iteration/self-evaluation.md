# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
* I still need to work on some of the methods as there a lot of them. I plan on studying these more in my study time in the morning.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
* This was great and how ever it was kinda hard to figure out what to do for the second challenge. That took a lot of mistakes to figure out!

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
* I need to continue to practice putting all methods together as well as remember the main types of iterations.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
* I do not have any questions at this time but still just need a lot of practice to become comfortable with writing more complex code than just puts.
