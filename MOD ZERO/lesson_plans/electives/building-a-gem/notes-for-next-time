Move the gem itself into turingschool-examples?
  https://github.com/JoshCheek/gitloc

Make the name of the gem consistent with naming patterns?
  makes the namespacing a little more annoying, though :/

Update links to my gh to instead point to lesson_plans repo
  https://github.com/JoshCheek/elective-building-a-gem

Add note on my repo to indicate that material has moved into this repo
  old: https://github.com/JoshCheek/elective-building-a-gem
  new: https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/electives/building-a-gem

Would be awesome to get the gem published on day 1
