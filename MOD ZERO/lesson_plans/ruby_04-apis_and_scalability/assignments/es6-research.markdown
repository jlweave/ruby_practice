## ES6 Research

Throughout the module (and your journey to Google enlightenment while working on IdeaBox2.0) you may notice a few different ways that JavaScript code is being written.

That might have something to do with something called `ES6` and `ES5`

### Deliverable

  - Fork This Gist
  - Respond in your forked gist with answers to the following questions
    - What is `ES6`?
    - What is Transpilation and how does it relate to `ES6`?
    - Looking at the ES6 Features link below, discuss one update from `ES5` and if it seems useful/superfluous
  - You can use the resources below or your own Google-fu
