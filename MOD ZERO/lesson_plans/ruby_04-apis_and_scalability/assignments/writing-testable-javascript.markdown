## Writing Testable JavaScript - Conference Talk

How do professional JavaScript developers think about testing their code? How do they organize their code so that it can be tested in the first place?

## Deliverable

  - Watch [Writing Testable JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzjogCFO4Zo) - Rebecca Murphey from Full Frontal 2012 (award for worst conference name ever?)
    * Consider the four responsibilities that Rebecca lists for client side code (hint: they're color coded).
      * Did any of the responsibilities that she lists surprise you?
      * Do you feel like you mentally split your client side code in IdeaBox and other past projects into these responsibilities?
