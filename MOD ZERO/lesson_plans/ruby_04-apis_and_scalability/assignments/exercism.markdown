## Exercism Comparisons

By now you are probably starting to get the feeling of ***Okay I can get things to work in JavaScript but how to do I get my code to not look like a horrible dumpster fire?!?***

The best way to start getting a feeling for how code is written in other languages is by seeing how other people code, and comparing their style to your own critically.

Luckily, we have an amazing tool called [exercism.io][exer] which allows us to do that.

## Deliverable

  - Compare ***3*** of your own completed [exercism.io][exer] exercises in JavaScript, writing a gist of what you saw when comparing the answer to five other answers that other folks got.
    - [Here is an example of what we expect.](https://gist.github.com/tgraham777/9f284f096ba9da89a159)
  - Fork This Gist
  - Include a link to your results or the results themselves in the body of the forked gist

If you have trouble with the exercism UI, you can find other versions of exercisms you submitted at this link:http://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/exercises
