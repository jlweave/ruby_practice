# 1602 Retro Notes

[Agenda](https://gist.github.com/rrgayhart/d8569bc41ea0f6dbf49b215e241daa74)

The three major divisions in Mod 4 (as per Ashwin) that should be balanced/thought about:

- Getting a Job
- Graduating
- Learning Something Cool

# Student Suggestions/Notes

### Should/Could We 'Deliver More' for Scale Up?

[Gist](https://gist.github.com/thompickett/5f2c461d81de2aa4a19586a6c33106e1)

Could we deliver more with it?
  - Maybe/maybe not but there shouldn't be more pressure

Should we deliver more?

- No we're going to reiterate what Ashwin said. More checkins would be awesome if they are about what support could we use, but definitely not checkins that are graded or count towards anything. Mod4 is enough with the jobs and graduating and projects.

### Goals/More Checkins

[Gist](https://gist.github.com/Claudia108/8bac99efc932c5ca7fd4ad29878472e8)

* Optional additional checkins to accomodate for different needs:
  * some might like/want more guidance and push to try out new things, need to reevaluate
  * some need more flexibility to work on their own/ also use more time for job search
* Optional in person project evaluation (you are already doing that, right?)
  * To gage how the output of scale up would range in the job world
  * Did I deliver enough for two weeks on the job?
  * Is the quality of my work/code base comparable? What do I need to improve?
  * How was my workflow/process?

### Scale Up and Classes in General

[Gist](https://gist.github.com/patrickwhardy/36066128e6e3411946053aa0f5f53cb0)

  Would it be helpful to integrate DSA/interview-cakes style prep/classes?
    Everyone is thinking about jobs and we don't feel that we're prepped to answer some of these questions

  Shorter classes would be nice.
    Very hard to focus for the whole 3 hours
      We liked the format of CSS/Reg-ex fun times - this kept us engaged and was fun
    More on the mind than straight programming right now.

  More on JavaScript testing.
    Need more structure on how to navigate JS test-suites and/or practice in one framework
    Time becoming solid in one thing.

  JavaScript - more time learning one framework or more explanation about why to use different frameworks
    i.e. gametime starter kit - may have been much more useful to build this/understand anything going on there
    need exercises and/or workshops in how to build a JS backend

  Diagnostic restructure seems good - ambiguous execution was bad

  Optional classes - good
    Make it more clear that we can just go and count the hours. Many people took it seriously that the class needed to be relevant to your project.

### Thank Mentors

[Gist](https://gist.github.com/drew-t/8f373eda74785df1a18920c2e3856853)

    Make video of us saying thank you and have Sunny Video Productions incorporate it.

### Motivation:

[Gist](https://gist.github.com/drew-t/8f373eda74785df1a18920c2e3856853)

    2nd check-in mid-week-2 would help to make us think more about concrete accomplisments

    Have options for more structured class/project combo

    1-on-1's missing from module (maybe having one at very beginning of scale-up would get people thinking more about options/interests)
