## Overview

Students will act out sensing, control flow, and events, then implement those concepts using Scratch. 

## Learning Goals

* use sensing methods to return true/false values
* repeat actions using loops
* combine sensing methods with if/else control flow
* trigger actions by "listening" to other events
* debug code

## Lesson

### Sensing

In video games, characters might need to "sense" things in order to determine what should happen next. For example, do they have more than one life left? Are they touching another character? What are other examples of what video game characters needing to sense things? 

Sensing methods will return either true or false. 

* touching
* key pressed
* mouse down

In Scratch, these are the pieces that have sharp edges and end in a question mark. They will return true or false. 

Activity: Have students respond *true* (thumbs up) or *false* (thumbs down) to the following sensor methods:

* wearing blue?
* standing up?
* smiling?
* outside?
* inside?
* in 5th grade?
* in 6th grade?
* In pairs, students come up with their own sensor methods and share with class.

### Control Flow

We can use control flow to determine what to do and when to do it. 

* Repeat # of times
* Repeat until
* Repeat forever

Can you think of a time in a video game where something would repeat? 

Activities:

1) Write repeat # of times loop on board and have student act it out.
2) Write a repeat until loop on board and have a student act it out.
3) In pairs, students demonstrate own repeat loop. 

We can combine control flow with the sensing methods to decide whether or not to do something. 

* If/then
* If/else/then

Activities: 

1) Write an if statement for if touching the wall, turn 180 degrees. Have a student act it out.
2) Write an if/else statement for if sitting, then clap hands once; else jump once. Have a student act it out.
3) In pairs, students come up with own if or if/else statements and share out with class. 

### Events

Imagine you're in class and the bell rings. This means it's time to go! We could write this action for you like this:

* When the bell rings
  - pack up materials and leave class

Think of events as things that a character watches or listens for. For example, your teacher might say "When I say go, find a partner". You're listening for the event where your teacher says "go".

Activities:

1) Have students brainstorm and jot down event triggers. Share out with class. 

In Scratch, there are several events we can listen or watch for: 

* When flag clicked
* When key pressed
* When sprite is clicked
* When loudness > ?

### Let's Try it in Scratch!

Get started:

Take one minute to choose a background and a sprite. 

Challenges:

1) Write a script to make your sprite walk until it reaches the edge. When it touches the edge, it should make a sound.

2) Write a script to your spirte move up when the up arrow is pressed, down when the down arrow is pressed, left when the left arrow is pressed, and right when the right arrow is pressed.  

3) Write a script to make the background change whenever the loudness is greater than 8.

4) Add one new sprite. Write a script where the first sprite will walk until it touches the second sprite. When it touches the second sprite, it should say hello to that sprite.
