## Overview

Students will create sets of instructions in order to have a "robot" (another student) create a structure out of cups. After "coding" using paper and cups, students will explore the motion, looks, sound, and pen scripts on MIT's Scratch software. 

## Learning Goals

* convert real-world activities into instructions
* code using symbols and scripts
* understand why precision in coding is important
* debug code
* use the Scratch IDE to create motion, looks, and sound scripts for multiple sprites

## Preparation

* set of symbols (print these out before session and cut apart)
* set of cup stack formations (print these out before session)
* stack of 6 cups per group

## Structure

* 5 - Staff introductions
* 5 - Vocabulary
* 10 - Instructions and staff demo
* 10 - Group robot exercise
* 5 - Brain break
* 10 - Intro to Scratch
* 15 - Scratch experimentation time

## Vocabulary

* Algorithm: A series of instructions on how to accomplish a task
* Coding - Transforming actions into a symbolic language
* Debugging - Finding and fixing issues in code

## Lesson

(From http://csedweek.org/files/CSEDrobotics.pdf)

Start by asking the class if anyone has heard of robotics. Has anyone seen a robot
or touched one? Does it really “understand” what you say? The answer to the last question is:
“Not the same way that a person does.”

Robots operate off of “instructions”, specific sets of things that they have been
preprogrammed to do. In order to accomplish a task, a robot needs to have a series
of instructions (sometimes called an algorithm) that it can run. Today, we are
going to learn what it takes to make that happen. 

Pull out a copy of the Symbol Key (or write the symbols on the board). Step to the
side and tell the class that these will be the only six symbols that they will be using
for this exercise. For this task, they will instruct their “robot” to build a specific
cup stack using only these arrows:

* Pick Up Cup
* Put Down Cup
* Move 1/2 Cup Width Forward
* Move 1/2 Cup Width Backward
* Turn Cup Right 90°
* Turn Cup Left 90°

## Steps

* Have staff members demo this before breaking students into groups. 
* Break students into groups of three, then have them do the following steps:

1. Choose one “Robot” per team.
2. Send robot to “Robot Library” while the “programmers” code.
3. Choose one image from the Cup Stack Pack for each group.
4. Groups will create an algorithm for how the robot should build the selected stack.
5. Coders will translate their algorithm to arrows, as described in Symbol Key.
6. When programmers have finished coding their stack they can retrieve their robot.
7. Upon return, the robot reads the symbols from the cards and translates them back
in to movements.
8. The group should watch for incorrect movements, then work together to debug
their program before asking the robot to re-run it.

Rules:

1. Coders should translate all moves using only the six arrows suggested.
2. Cups should remain with the robot, not provided to programmers during coding.
3. Once robots are back with their groups, there should be no talking out loud.

## Intro to Scratch

Now that we've learned why precision is important in coding, let's try it out using MIT's Scratch software. 

* Students open laptops and navigate to [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
* Click `create` button near upper left corner. 

#### Tools

* Help menu (you can close this)
* Stage: sprites, backdrop, position
* Sprites: creating new sprites
* Scripts: we'll focus today on motion, looks, sound, and pen. Next week we'll play around with the rest of them. 
* Costumes: think of costumes as the way a character appears
* Editor: use this to construct your program

#### What you can do

* Dragging scripts to editor
* Starting script (or set of scripts) by clicking on it
* Right-clicking to delete
* Create scripts for multiple sprites (click on the sprite first -- you can tell which sprite you're coding for by looking at which one is highlighted)

#### Experimentation time

* Can you create a script that includes motion, looks, and a sound for the existing cat sprite?
* Can you add a new sprite? Can you create a script for that sprite? 

### Closing

Students pair up to demo their code. 

* Why is it important to be precise in our code, regardless of whether we're using paper or computers?
