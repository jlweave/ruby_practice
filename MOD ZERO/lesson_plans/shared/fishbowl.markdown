# Fishbowl

## Big Picture

This exercise is designed to:

* foster communication
* create a safe space for real talk
* celebrate strengths and wins
* bring to light struggles and issues
* increase the gravitational pull of the group's core

## Calculating Duration & Groupings

Assuming you have **N** students and **G** groups, your total time for the exercise will be:

```
x = N * ((N / G) + 1)
total = x + ((x / 35) * 5)
```

For example, 24 students split into 6 feedback groups:

```
N = 24
G = 6
x = 24 * ((24/6) + 1) = 24 * 5 = 120
total = 120 + 4 * 5 = 140 minutes = 2.33 hours
```

If you know the time you want to hit, you can use this variant to find the group size:

```
L = total length in minutes
G = N*N / ((35*L/40) - N)
```

So for 24 students to fit into 120 total minutes:

```
G = 24*24 / ((35*120/40) - 24) = 7.11
Therefore 8 groups to be safe or 7 groups if you're going to be stingy with timing
```

## Setup

Assuming you have **N** number of participants you'll need:

* A room configured with a tight ring of N-1 seats on the outside and one seat in the middle
* 1 bowl
* N + G small cards or squares of paper
* A timer capable of minute + second timing

Using the number of feedback groups that you calculated above, `G`, create
`N/G + 1` cards per group with the group number on it.

So if you have 24 students being split into 8 groups, you'd create four `1` cards,
four `2` cards, four `3` cards, etc so there are four each of `1` through `8`.

You'll also need a randomized list of the participants.

## Beginning

Explain to the participants the ground rules:

* Each person will have a turn in the fishbowl
* When you're in the middle you're not to talk or respond
* On the outside everyone has a single number card
* The facilitator will use a one minute timer

## Each Round

* Starting with the "1s"
* Going around the room, each participant with a "1" card gives a minute of feedback (timed)
* The feedback should include at least one positive support and one critique
* Then continue around the room
* When all the "1s" have spoken, then the facilitator asks for a "+1" -- an additional person who has something to contribute
* Then the person in the center has 1 minute to respond/comment

Then the facilitator puts the next person from the randomized list into the center.

When *all* the groups have given feedback then the numbers should be placed back into the bowl,
shuffled, and redrawn.

When all students have been in the fishbowl, the facilitator/module instructors take a turn.
