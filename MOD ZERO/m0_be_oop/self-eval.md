# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
This was a lot, but I think the most frusterating part was I knew that I knew the answers it was just had to put them in the correct way to make the code work.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Work flow will be something that I continue to work with. I have done better about short breaks but now I have taken very little breaks. I go until my brain gets fried, I need to start setting a timer.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I need to be more structured with my time and realize that i need to step away sometime and that I am not always going to know the answers and I need to find them or ask for help.
