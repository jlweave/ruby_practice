## Deliverables:

First, create a new [Gist on Github](https://gist.github.com/). Copy and paste the markdown from [this template](https://gist.github.com/mikedao/cf0f63490a0ef91ac7d251e95fc410f7) into your gist.

This Gist will be your submission for your intermission work. Each of the assignments includes a Check for Understanding that you must complete in your Gist. Some of the assignments will also ask you to include a link to a GitHub repo.

**Deliverables are due 5:00 pm the Saturday before the module begins. Prework must be completed in its entirety in order to be successful in Mod 2.**


## Assignments

Work on the following assignments in order. Each assignment will assume that you have completed the previous one and the accompanying Checks for Understanding. **Ruby v2.7.4 and Rails 5.2.8 are required.**

Time-box recommendations are in each section's instructions, and also included here for convenience. 

1. [Ruby and Rails versions installation guide](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/misc/ruby_and_rails_versions)

### If you are Repeating

Do a modified version of the assignments above:

* Complete a timed [Static Challenge](./static_challenge) (2 hrs)
    * If you did Challenge 1 the first time, do Challenge 2, and vice versa.
