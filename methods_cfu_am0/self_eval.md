# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I am still a little shaky on methods. There is time that I feel like I get it and then other times I dont know where to start. It is something that I am going to have to study.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
Simple methods are making sense now and I think that I can write them with out any help.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
As of right now I am still shaky on if, else, elsif statements in method form. It just doesn't make sense in my brain yet.
