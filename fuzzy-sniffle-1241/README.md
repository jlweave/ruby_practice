## Overview
Order Up is an app that tracks chefs, the dishes that they make, and the ingredients that are in those dishes. Chefs have many dishes. Dishes belong to a chef. Dishes have many Ingredients and Ingredients have many dishes. Ingredients should have a name and calories.
 
Two migrations have been made for you. The one to many relationship has been set up. You will need to create migrations for the many to many relationship between ingredients and dishes. You do not need to do model testing for validations, just make sure you test any relationships and model methods that you create.
 
(Note: The plural of dish is dishes. The plural of chef is chefs.)
