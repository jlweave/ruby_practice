### Check for Understanding
At the end of this lesson, students should be able to answer the following questions:

1. In each exercise/scenario you completed, how do the objects you created relate to each other?
1. What are the responsibilities of each class? Are there ever responsibilities that "leak" into other classes?
1. Why do you think we separate these classes and their responsibilities out in the first place? What would the code look like if we ___didn't___ do this?
